how are articles stored?
	html pages or simple text
	each page has a title
	each page has tags
	must be really simple

idea: use the dropbox api and have a dropbox folder as the content source
	or use a local folder
	or use a list of folders
	some folder that can be accessed by some protocol somewhere will be a content source
	the server periodically scans the source folders and builds a content db
	the db itself contains pages, tags
	but the db should be as minimal as possible
	just have information that can't be stored in the file itself, like page access counts, tag access counts

scannerService
	be able to retrieve files in order of last modifiation date
	scan everything once on startup and keep an in-memory db
	scan periodically and only look at file titles and for some content type at file meta-data
	file title can also contain tags: my new page [new] [test][random].txt
	each file is identified by a path

a title page which shown the latest changes and also a tag tree
we have information on what were the latests accessed tags

Scanner service
    different scanners for different data sources
    scans a data source and returns a list of pages to be save in the content DB
