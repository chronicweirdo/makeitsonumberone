when we configure this server:
    we have source folders
        each source folder has:
            scannerService - responsible with going through the folder and
                obtaining data about posts
            a list of parser/template pairs - responsible with interpreting
                post sections and putting them in a contents list (another model)
            a master template - will take all contents and put them in the final
                web page
    each source folder has an associated posts handler that serves the post pages
    each source folder also has an associated resources handler

    we also have pages
        well, the main page for now

need some way to define parsers (or metion what parses we will use and initialise
    them) in config files
    see spring config files
    see how we can reload spring context periodically

rescan content folder periodically (reload)

build a tree of parsers and templates in config files and apply that processing tree
    on content folders

add styles


SourceService
    scans sources and returns a list of posts
    caching and periodic rescanning
    configuration: a list of source folders

BuilderService
    takes a post and assembles it into a HtmlPage
    configuration: a collection of parsers and templates associated with processor names
