when we configure this server:
    we have source folders
        each source folder has:
            filename parser - responsible with going through the folder and
                obtaining data about posts
            a list of parser/template pairs - responsible with interpreting
                post sections and putting them in a contents list (another model)
            a master template - will take all contents and put them in the final
                web page
    each source folder has an associated posts handler that serves the post pages
    each source folder also has an associated resources handler

    we also have pages
        well, the main page for now
