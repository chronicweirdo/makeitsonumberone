data storage
	primitives
	objects (maps) association of names to values
	value = a primitive or an object
	path = a list of names (dot notation)
	reference = name of a variable and path
	path + object = value
functions
	*** condition is a hairy one
	*** i need a way to define a condition with placeholders that can be applied on some generic set of arguments
	*** actually a condition is a function that returns a value!!!, usually boolean
	condition = test + attributes and returns a boolean value
	test = and, or, equals, exists, ....
	attribute = a value or a reference or a placeholder or a condition between paranthesis
