    <p>How is a patch applied:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>we get a list of all files in the application</li>
        <li>a file has a name and an extension</li>
        <li>
            create matchings between patch files and application files
            <ul>
                <li>same extension</li>
                <li>file starts with the same text (end of file name may contain version)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        apply patch by switching original files with patch files
        rename patch files to the same name as original files? optional
        keep original files in backup (original name + extension, followed by the patch timestamp)

        now how do we apply multiple patches and revert them?

EXAMPLE RUN:
        original:
        ipaweb-1.0.123456.jar

        we patch with ipaweb-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:
        ipaweb-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar is matched with ipaweb-1.0.123456.jar
        ipaweb-1.0.123456.jar moved to backup ipaweb-1.0.123546.jar.1
        ipaweb-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar is moved to ipaweb-1.0.123456.jar

        we patch with a new ipaweb-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
        ipaweb-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar is matched with ipaweb-1.0.123456.jar
        ipaweb-1.0.123456.jar move to backup ipaweb-1.0.123456.jar.2
        ipaweb-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar is moved to ipaweb-1.0.123456.jar

        we now have two patches on the application: 1 and 2, in order
        we can revert patch 2 (go back to patch 1) or revert patch 1 (reverts all patches applied until patch 1 is reverted).

        REVERT PATCH 2:
        we select backup files: ipaweb-1.0.123456.jar.2
        we remove ipaweb-1.0.123456.jar
        we move ipaweb-1.0.123456.jar.2 to ipaweb-1.0.123456.jar

        REVERT PATCH 1:
        REVERT PATCH 2
        REVERT PATCH 1
