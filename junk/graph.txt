graphs
nodes have identities
	for example a node identity can be a file name
	or the contents of mp3 tags
	(one node can link to one or more real objects, based on the identity computed on the real object)
	(somehow changes to the real object that affect the identiy should be done through the system so the

we create links between nodes to define our data structure
we use the links to build complex queries


a query is applied on a graph and we get back something
	do we get back nodes?
	do we get back links?
	do we get back both?
	we get back a subgraph! both nodes and links
	the query is a filter

	how is this query applied?
	go over all nodes?
	go over all links?
	shortcuts?

a node/link should contain a set of tag-value entries
a node/link is equal to another node/link if:
    all tag-value entries in both are exactly the same
    based on an identifier definition
        the identifier specifies which tags should contain the same values for both nodes/links for them to be equal
