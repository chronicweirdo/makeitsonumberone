<p>What it is about: user stories, acceptance tests, what acceptance tests should be testing, fit framework, how we
connect executable acceptance tests into the system.</p>

<h1>Acceptance TDD explained</h1>

<h2>User stories</h2>
<ul>
    <li>we need to know how our system should behave</li>
    <li>a simple way of expressing requirements: <em>who</em> does <em>what</em> (and <em>why</em>)</li>
    <li>Hannah Arendt: <em>"storytelling reveals meaning without committing the error of defining it"</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Acceptance tests</h2>
<ul>
    <li>specifications for the desired behavior and functionality of a system</li>
    <li>
        <p>An example user story: Support technician sees customer's history on screen at the start of a call.</p>
        <p>Exaple tests:
            <ul>
                <li>Simulate a call with Fred's account number and verify that Fred's info can be read from the screen;</li>
                <li>Verify that the system displays a valid error message for a non-existing account number;</li>
                <li>Omit the account number in the incoming call completely and verify that the system displays the text "no account number provided" on the screen.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>owned by the customer</li>
    <li>written together with the customer, developer and tester</li>
    <li>expressed in the language of the problem domain</li>
    <li>concise, precise and unambiguous</li>
    <li>focus on the <em>what</em>, not the <em>how</em></li>
    <li>a test with too much detail: go to the new transaction screen, fill in the required details and save the entry; verify that the transaction shows up in the list</li>
</ul>

<h3>Understanding the process</h3>
<ul>
    <li>a cycle consisting of: pick a story, write tests, automate tests, implement functionality</li>
</ul>
