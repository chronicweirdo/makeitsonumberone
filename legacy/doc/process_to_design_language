maybe one way to figure out how a programming language can be encoded into a
data structure is by writing progressively more complicated pieces of
pseudocode and try to move it into the desired data structure

first, define basic programming language functinality:
	data
		stores information
		primitives and maps
	instructions
		used to modify data
		basic functionality provided by the language
	functions
		grouping of instructions
		have inputs and outputs
		have specific contexts
		how is parent context inherited to child context in a map that can
			reference values in the parent
			need a map that contains entries in the parent as well
			implement own hash-table based map implementation that also accepts
			entries, not just key-value put
