1.
we could just have a context for everything

2.
we could have a context stack, with the global context at the bottom and function specific contexts
above it
the function specific context would also contain the call values (aparameters)
a function context is altered by instructions, which are some sort of smaller functions - too much
complexity

3.
we could have functions that create their own context and functions that operate on the topmost
context
functions operating on topmost context:
	assign
	mathematical
functions creating their own context:
	block
